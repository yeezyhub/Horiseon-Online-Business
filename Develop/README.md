# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

In today's world there are many devices to surf the web plus many people with different disabilities that needs accessible perks such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards to access websites all around the world. My motivation was to make Horiseon's website more accessible to everybody. I've learned that I can achieve that using semantic HTML elements to meet the standards of the market and to be better positioned in search engines like Google while helping people with disability. This way people can access this website much easily and increase the traffic to this website among other website results in search engines.
